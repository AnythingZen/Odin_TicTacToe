# [Odin Tic Tac Toe](https://anythingzen.github.io/Odin_TicTacToe/)

## Issues Encountered 
1. Trying to get logic right with using higher order functions. (Ended up going with basic for loops most of the time)
2. Took a massive load of time trying to debug why my 'tie' alert kept coming up. Realised its due to array not initialized with proper length.
